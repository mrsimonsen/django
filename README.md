# django
for learning django
Now for making a blog site

[Django Web Framework Class from moz://a](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django)
[Current Section:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment) @ "Testing your installation"

## Notes:
* I liked the idea of writing blog posts in markdown then having them converted to html [this may work](https://www.imzjy.com/blog/2018-05-20-render-the-markdown-in-django)
* not usign a virual environment since it will be deployed on a raspberry pi server
